# Response to reviews of “Wikidata and the bibliography of life”

Dear Gabriele Casazza,

My apologies for the delay in submitting a revision. Please find below my response to the reviews of the previous version of this manuscript. Firstly I summarise the key changes I’ve made, then reproduce the original reviews with my responses indicated. I found the reviews to be very useful, I hope you will find my responses to be satisfactory.

Regards,

Rod Page

## Summary

The major changes I have made are to drop the discussion of the web site ALEC completely (reviewers 2 and 3), and to redo the analysis with a ten-fold larger sample of publications (10,000 rather than 1,000) (reviewer 1). I have updated the corresponding figures and tables, notably Figure 10 (now Figure 6) which all reviewers struggled with. I have also justified the use of the term “bibliography of life” (which reviewer 1 liked - permissible as being memorable” - but reviewer 2 had issues with). I have also added some further clarifications where needed.

In the comments below my responses are shown in bold italics.


## Reviewer: David Shotton
### Basic reporting
This short article presents a detailed examination of whether Wikidata is a suitable repository for bibliographic information relating to scholarly papers describing the taxonomy of biological species. The “life” of the article's title thus has a very precise and restricted meaning of biological species and their taxonomic organization, and totally excludes other areas of biology such as animal behaviour, gene function or cellular ultrastructure. The shorthand phrase “the bibliography of life” is clearly defined to have this restricted meaning by the author, and is permissible as being memorable. 

> I have further justified this term in the revision

The article is clear, well-written, properly referenced and well supported by tables, figure and raw data files, and thus meets all the criteria required by PeerJ in terms of basic reporting. There are a number of minor typographical corrections and suggestions for changes of wording or emphasis that I have noted as Comments within the PDF of the article itself (attached). 

> I have fixed the typos


These, together with more serious points noted below concerning the sample of 1000 bibliographic entities and the representation of the edit data on these entities presented in Fig. 7, and my suggestion for two concluding tables, must be addressed by the author before the revised article is resubmitted.


### Experimental design
Unlike most PeerJ papers that report experimental research directly into biological phenomena, the research reported in this article is into the availability of bibliographic information contained (or potentially contained) within Wikidata relating to papers describing biological species. It thus falls somewhere between a Research Article and a Literature Review Article, the two types of report permitted to appear within PeerJ. The conclusions of the paper are highly relevant to biology and 'open science' as a whole, and to modern on-line methods of discovering information about individual species, which makes PeerJ a very suitable journal for its publication. Lest there be any hesitation on the part of PeerJ editors about its suitability for PeerJ, it should be noted that the taxonomic publications that are the subjects of the investigation reported in this article are themselves not “research” in the sense of experimental investigations, but rather are descriptive observational reports about the existence of species. Thus these publications too, which lie at the very heart of biology, lie outside our conventional understanding of “experimental biology”. 

Because the article is not a typical experimental research report, this review is also atypical, particularly in this Experimental Design section.

In evaluating this article, it is important to realize that the author is both a specialist in biological taxonomy and an expert user of Wikidata. He is thus ideally placed to write on the subject of the article. 

The body of the article falls into two main parts. 

The first part, “Wikidata”, is a clear and helpful description of Wikidata, explaining how information is recorded within it and made freely available to scholars and the general public, the original sources of such information (particularly of taxonomic and bibliographic information), how items of such information are entered and may subsequently be edited either by people or 'bots', and the special factors that make this information repository suitable for bibliographic information relating to scholarly papers describing the taxonomy of biological species.

The second part, “Exploring Bibliographic Data in Wikidata”, is an investigation of the extent to which Wikidata lives up to its potential in providing a comprehensive repository for the bibliographic information under review, and includes an honest evaluation of the shortcomings and problems inherent in the Wikidata method of information provision and editing by an unpaid community of experts volunteering their time and expertise.

In this second section, the author first describes open software he himself has developed that provides the functionality within a simple website called ALEC (All Literature Electronically Catalogued), giving the user convenient access to the bibliographic information recorded within Wikidata, and illustrates how ALEC returns different types of data.

He then evaluates the Wikidata information for a sample of 1000 bibliographic entities recorded in Wikidata, in terms of the frequency of edits of these records, their citation links to other publications, etc., before going on to look at the taxonomic and author coverage for Wikidata as a whole. To the extent that this article involves experimental investigation, it is here in this section, and it is here that my main criticisms of the article rest. 

First, the author announces his analysis of the sample of 1000 publications without describing how this sample of 1000 was selected from all the relevant publications within Wikidata, and whether the method of selection might influence the results obtained. This is a very serious omission that must be rectified. Ideally, one would like to see the same analyses run on multiple samples of 1000 publications, but in reality I don't think this would add anything significant to the paper, since it is the general trends revealed by the analyses that are important, rather than particular numerical values.

> I have redone the analysis with a much larger sample (10,000) and explained the source of that sample.

Second, in Figure 7, the figure that shows the number of edits each of this 1000 publication entries in Wikidata has received, the initial entry date for the information about each publication is indicated on the figure diagonal by a dot. Unfortunately, the size of the dot used is so great that the figure appears to show only about 100 publications, not the full 1000, since individual dots overlap. At least, I assume that to be the explanation for the small number of apparent dots. The author should discuss this overlap problem, and should fix it by revising the figure. Either smaller dots with different colours should be used, or an electronically zoomable figure should be provided, to enable the results for different publications to be individually visible. 

> I have reduced the size of the dots so that more a now visible. It shows the edit history for 10,000 items. The foal isn’t to make each history visible, but simply to demonstrate that there are extensive edits being made, the data is not static.

Third, in the discussion of the data in Fig. 7, there appears to be an implicit assumption that, following initial data entry, a large number of edits on the information relating to each publication is a 'good thing'. However, if the information was fully and correctly entered initially, no subsequent editing of the entry would be required. The author should explicitly address this point.

> As shown when examine the kinds of edits being made, and the density of the knowledge graph, the data is far from being fully correct at the time of entry.


### Validity of the findings
With the exceptions of the problems relating to the sample of 1000 publications and to Figure 7, discussed above, the conclusions drawn from this investigation of Wikidata are clearly presented and straightforwardly discussed.

### Additional comments
Within the presentation of the results of his investigation, and in the concluding Discussion, the author has clearly and honestly set out both the advantages and also the present limitations and quirks of Wikidata as a potential repository for the Bibliography of Life. Of these, the most important limitations are the lack of an adequate data model that separates taxa and their names, the possibility for different editors to create duplicate entries for the same publication, the recording of many authors as name strings rather than as entities with names, the current lack of comprehensive coverage of the field, the lack of persistent identifiers (e.g. DOIs, Digital Object Identifiers) for much of the taxonomic literature, and the limited size of the community of taxonomists currently working with data in Wikidata, which limits the rate of progress. 

The potential for Wikidata to become in reality the repository to document the Bibliography of Life is very exciting, and the author is to be highly commended both for clearly explaining that vision in this article, and also for his excellent work to make it a reality. This article itself is sure to encourage additional work in this area.

> Nice comment!

However, it would be most helpful for the general reader if the author could provide two additional summary tables of the information and conclusions presented in this article, to be included in the Discussion section, the first listing the advantages of Wikidata as a repository for the Bibliography of Life, and the second listing the present limitations and quirks of Wikidata as a repository for the Bibliography of Life, and the steps that would be required to remedy these drawbacks.

> Rather than provide a table I have further discussed some issues regarding Wikidata, and cited relevant literature on potential gaps and biases in wiki projects.

### Major comments
This manuscript provides an interesting idea regarding the usage of Wikidata as a global repository and structured database for taxonomic publications. Moreover, it provides a lot of information on the structure of the Wikidata entities, and their potential for this task. 

However, I was a bit baffled by the overall goal, structure, and narrative of this contribution. While the author argues that Wikidata can be such a curated taxonomic database (e.g. in the abstract). It ends the MS by claiming that “Consequently a large number of taxonomic works and their authors already exist in Wikidata. As more and more taxonomic publications acquire DOIs, and as more working taxonomists acquire ORCID ids, the taxonomic literature component of Wikidata will automatically grow as content linked to these identifiers is routinely harvested by Wikidata bots. This leaves a large fraction of the taxonomic literature to be added by other means, but as discussed here there are numerous ways to do that. It is not unreasonable to expect that the bulk of the taxonomic literature will find its way into Wikidata in the next few years.”. So what are we to gain from this contribution? An acknowledgment of this fact? More understanding of the inner working of Wikidata? A call to use this source for this purpose? I think that I eventually got lost in this forest. Currently I finished reading this piece and had a hard time thinking what I have actually gained from it beyond the fact that Wikidata can be used as a taxonomic bibliography source – which you could probably state in much fewer words. 

Linked to this critique I found your very limited discussion of the (many potential) drawbacks of Wikidata use for this purpose particularly lacking. I would greatly limit and reduce the current narrative of the MS, remove repetition in it and have a comprehensive section on drawbacks and limitations of Wikidata as a curated taxonomic bibliography source (and how these could potentially be addressed).

Perhaps you can structure both your main ideas, gaps to be filled, and potential limitations as a conceptual figure, that would help illuminate your statement(s). This together with much refocusing of the MS towards a specific agenda/target could greatly improve it.

> I have tweaked the order of some of the arguments, and removed the discussion of the web site. I think the manuscript now flows better, and I believe the points it makes are useful and relevant to the stated goals (constructing a “bibliography of life”). I find it difficult to respond to “the (many potential) drawbacks of Wikidata” if none are specified. 

Moreover, I think that claiming that your concept of Wikidata usage for this purpose is the “bibliography of life” a bit grandiose and I’d remove it from the title onwards. Having a central curated, structured, and interlinked, repository of taxonomic publications is a very important and impressive task, but hardly the “bibliography of life” this will be a bibliography of taxonomic works. 

> I have further justified the term bibliography of life and why “bibliography of life” is appropriate.

Lastly, the presentation of the author’s online tool in the MS does not seem to contribute to other potential messages found in it.

> I have removed all mention of ALEC.

### Minor comments
Line 65: Space missing after parenthesis

Figure 10 – I think there is a mistake in the node linking Wikispecies and zoobank, as the node between them contains many more shared authors than those listed in zoobank itself

## Reviewer: John Mittermeier
Basic reporting
Clear, well-written and interesting. This paper meets all requirements in terms of basic reporting.

Experimental design
This paper does not involve traditional hypothesis testing approach but instead is reads more like an opinion piece highlighting and advocating the use of Wikidata in this context. Thus it does not have the usual Methods section. I think that's fine. The structure and design of the paper is appropriate for its context and thesis.

Validity of the findings
Findings and conclusions are relevant, interesting and well-supported.

Additional comments
Great work on this paper overall. I enjoyed reading it and found it interesting and important. I have three comments on places where I think it could be improved:

1. Inclusion of the ALEC website. This website is interesting and clearly related to the topic. However, its introduction felt out of place within the context of the paper. The thesis of the paper is that Wikidata can be used as a “centralized, curated literature database [for biological taxonomy].” While the ALEC site is a tool for exploring this, it is not critical supporting this thesis. Furthermore, as a user seeking to understand the ALEC tool I probably would not think to look to this paper for site documentation (though referenced, the site is not directly named in the abstract). 

I think it would make more sense to move the ALEC description and documentation out of the paper and put it elsewhere. A supplement or something similar to the online documentation for R packages could be an example for this. The paragraphs beginning with lines 323 and 331 and Figs 3-6 could all be moved to ALEC site documentation rather than being part of this paper.

> I have removed ALEC from the manuscript as suggested.

2. The community of Wikidata editors and contributors. As the author points out the Wikidata community of editors is a benefit (line 455) and also in some ways a challenge (line 469). It is important to include some additional discussion of who constitutes this community. From Fig 9 its obvious that relatively few contributors may contribute disproportionately to the content. What biases might emerge from this? Wikipedia editors have significant geographic and demographic skews and some of the literature on this could be referenced as an example. A few sentences on this topic should be added to the section on "A community of editors".

> I have cited a recent entry point into the discussion about bias and gaps in Wikipedia.

3. Lines 476-481. The point about taxa vs. names is an important one but here feels thrown in at the last moment and not fully explained. It would be useful to add of couple of sentences earlier on in the paper clarifying what this is and explaining its potential impact.

> I agree this adds little so I have deleted it.

Other smaller comments:

1. Fig 10. I found this figure useful, but I think the information could be displayed in a cleaner and more easily interpretable way. A matrix similar to a correlation plot could be one approach: https://www.displayr.com/how-to-create-a-correlation-matrix-in-r/ 

> I have redrawn this in a more conventional form as everyone found it confusing.

2. Acronyms and technical terms. There are many mentioned in the paper. Are all of them necessary? It would be helpful to remove any acronyms that are not totally necessary to avoid confusion and help the reader. Of those that are included several need additional introduction beyond what is currently provided. For example: what are "quickstatements" (line 377), CONSTRUCT queries (line 332), what does ZOBODAT (line 31) stand for, etc.? Even SPARQL may not be known to all readers and should probably be briefly defined.

> I have expanded acronyms to make things more readable.
